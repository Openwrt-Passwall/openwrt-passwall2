PassWall2 is a powerful LuCI web interface application for OpenWrt that provides advanced proxy and VPN functionality. It's a comprehensive solution for network traffic management, proxy services, and access control on OpenWrt-based routers.

## 🛠️ Installation

### ⚠️ Pre-installation

```bash
# find it in releases,base of your router Arch
```
**Visit [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Openwrt-Passwall/openwrt-passwall2/releases/latest) to download the correct package for your system.**

Choose the package format based on your **router's OpenWrt package manager**:

### For OpenWrt with OPKG 

1. **Download the IPK package** from the releases page  
   Look for `luci-app-passwall2_{VERSION}_all.ipk` in the Assets section.  
   > **Note:** If you need localization (Chinese/Persian), download the corresponding language package as well (e.g., `luci-i18n-passwall2-zh-cn...` or `...-fa...`).

2. **Upload to your router** (via SCP, LuCI upload, or wget):
   ```bash
   # Replace {VERSION} with the actual version (e.g., 26.2.5-1)
   wget https://github.com/Openwrt-Passwall/openwrt-passwall2/releases/download/{VERSION}/luci-app-passwall2_{VERSION}_all.ipk
   ```

3. **Install:**
   ```bash
   opkg update
   opkg install luci-app-passwall2_*.ipk
   ```
   
   > If installation fails due to missing dependencies (e.g., `xray-core`), you need to add the PassWall packages feed to `/etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf`.

### For OpenWrt with APK 

1. **Download the APK package** from the releases page  
   Look for `luci-app-passwall2_{VERSION}_all.apk` in the Assets section.
   > **Note:** If you need localization (Chinese/Persian), download the corresponding language package as well (e.g., `luci-i18n-passwall2-zh-cn...` or `...-fa...`).

2. **Upload to your router** (via SCP, LuCI upload, or wget):
   ```bash
   # Replace {VERSION} with the actual version (e.g., 26.2.5-1)
   wget https://github.com/Openwrt-Passwall/openwrt-passwall2/releases/download/{VERSION}/luci-app-passwall2_{VERSION}_all.apk
   ```

3. **Install:**
   ```bash
   apk add --allow-untrusted luci-app-passwall2_*.apk
   ```
   
   > ⚠️ **Security Note:** `--allow-untrusted` bypasses package signature verification. 

> **How to check your package manager:** Run `opkg --version` or `apk --version` to see which one your router uses.

### Restart LuCI
```bash
/etc/init.d/rpcd restart
```

### 🧩 Add PassWall2 APK repository (recommended)
**Instead of installing .apk packages manually**, you can add the PassWall2 APK repository and signing key to enable installation and updates via apk.

1. Add repository signing key

```bash
wget -O passwall.pub https://sourceforge.net/projects/openwrt-passwall-build/files/apk.pub
mv passwall.pub /etc/apk/keys/
```

2. Add PassWall2 repositories

```bash
. /etc/openwrt_release

release="${DISTRIB_RELEASE%.*}"
arch="$DISTRIB_ARCH"

wget -O /etc/apk/keys/passwall.pub \
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/openwrt-passwall-build/files/apk.pub

cat >> /etc/apk/repositories.d/customfeeds.list <<EOF
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openwrt-passwall-build/files/releases/packages-${release}/${arch}/passwall_packages/packages.adb
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openwrt-passwall-build/files/releases/packages-${release}/${arch}/passwall_luci/packages.adb
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openwrt-passwall-build/files/releases/packages-${release}/${arch}/passwall2/packages.adb
EOF
```

3. Update package index

```bash
apk update
```

4. Install optional dependency packages (depending on your configuration) and PassWall2 from repository

```bash
apk add tcping geoview # add other dependencies

apk add luci-app-passwall2
```


## 📋 System Requirements

- `resolveip`, `tcping`, `unzip`
- `xray-core` (core proxy component)
- `geoview`, `v2ray-geoip`, `v2ray-geosite` (geo-routing data)

> **Note:** Actual dependencies may vary based on selected features and your OpenWrt build. Ensure you have the necessary feeds configured.
